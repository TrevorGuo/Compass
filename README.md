# Treasure Tracker
This is the software and CAD for treasure tracker, a compass that points to previously saved waypoints as opposed to north. Treasure Tracker is a great tool to use when you're in an unfamiliar area with no cell service or access to Google Maps. For example, if someone were to go on a hike in a seldom visited part of the wilderness. They could set a waypoint at the start of their hike, and continue with no fear of getting lost. It would also be a boon while camping as you could mark multiple useful spots such as your campsite, a nearby stream, or a parked car. The device would then allow you to quickly navigate to any of these locations, without the need to check a map. In addition, because of how easy it is to use and follow, it will be useful for younger users to get back to their campsite.
